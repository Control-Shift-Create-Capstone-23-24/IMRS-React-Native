Incident Monitoring and Response System (IMRS) is a communications platform designed to decrease response time while increasing survivability through smart phone applications by collecting, analyzing, and organizing crowdsourced data from the active shooter site and providing it to first responders in the form of a geographical heat signature.

The purpose of the document is to explain how the IMRS application will run, and how to run it on your own device. IMRS is an application meant to assist first responders in a school shooter situation. It will allow users to display their statuses on a heat map that will be shown to first responders. F.R. 's can use this information to determine the general location of the shooter in the building, and allow them to subdue the threat quickly and save as many lives as possible.
