To set up maps for IOS, edit the ./ios/reactNative/AppDelegate.mm file as with the following lines (the ones with pluses at the start of the line)

```diff
+ #import <GoogleMaps/GoogleMaps.h>

@implementation AppDelegate
...

(BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{

...
```

Edit the Podfile found at ./ios/reactIMRS/Podfile and add the following above the `use_native_modules!` function then run `pod install`.

```diff
rn_maps_path = '../node_modules/react-native-maps'
pod 'react-native-google-maps', :path => rn_maps_path
```


### Android

Run to generate the android directory.

```bash
npx expo run:android
```

Add the Google Map API Key to your AndroidManifest.xml file found at android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml. Add your API Key to the file.

```diff
<application>
   <!-- You will only need to add this meta-data tag, but make sure it's a child of application -->
   <meta-data
     android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
     android:value="Your Google maps API Key Here"/>
</application>
